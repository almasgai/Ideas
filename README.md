# Ideas
Writing down some ideas I might do

## Embedded Systems & IoT:
- Raspberry Pi based turntable
  * Need a 3D printer, record needle, servo to spin platter
  
- RC Car Pt. 2: fully autonomous, redesigned with Google Maps API
  * Would need to get _all_ the parts again and more ultrasonic sensors for 360 coverage
  
- Smart Mirror: display useful information and interactive via Google Assistant, Alex, etc.
  * Believe I actually have everything except for wood & acryllic glass
  
- An Arduino powered drone
  * Something I want to do before I graduate
  * Not sure how feasible it is but it would be cool to make it convert into a boat
  
- Retro Pi
  * Already has been done, but still something I really want to do
  
- Fingerprint scanner to get into room

## Graphics
- ~~Particle Simulation ~~
  * ~~Most likely in C++~~
  
## Algorithms
- Write a program that does lossless file compression

## Apps
- FlashNotes: summarizes OCR text 
  * Would have to use 2 libraries: one for OCR and another for text summarization
- Cross platform dynamic EQ
- Basic Calculator App
- Basic Chat App
